# VPPMap (v0.2.0)

VPPMap library for iOS simplifies the creation and management of a MKMapView. Features:
 
 - Automatic annotations management with their views and callouts. 
 - Map region centering based on the current visible annotations. 
 - Automatic annotation clustering.
 - Easy management of pins dropped by user.

### Extending MKMapViewDelegate implementation

 VPPMap provides an implementation to the most used methods found in 
`MKMapViewDelegate` protocol. However, you may need to implement some methods
 not implemented by VPPMap. In this case, you have two alternatives:
 
 - Create a category on VPPMapHelper and implement there all the `MKMapViewDelegate`
 methods you need. Be careful to not implement those already implemented 
 by VPPMapHelper.
 - Subclass VPPMapHelper. This will be a harder alternative, but more customizable.

This project contains a sample application using it. Just open the project in 
XCode, build it and run it.
