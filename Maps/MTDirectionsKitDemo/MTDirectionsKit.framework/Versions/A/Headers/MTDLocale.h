 This function sets the currently used locale for direction requests. This locale influences
 the language of the maneuver instructions returned by the used API. The default value is
 [NSLocale currentLocale]. Google Directions API as well as Bing Routes API return maneuvers in
 English, if the set locale isn't supported by the API, MapQuest does return an error-message.
 Therefore we check against a known list of supported locales when MapQuest is set as the API.
