/**
 An MTDMapView instance provides functionality to show directions directly on top of the MapView inside your App.
 MTDMapView is a subclass of MKMapView and therefore uses Apple's standard way of displaying map data, which we all
 know and love. Up until iOS 5 this means that Google Maps is used as a backend for the map data, starting with iOS 6
 Apple Maps are used.
 
 Sample usage:
 
 MTDMapView *_mapView = [[MTDMapView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
 _mapView.directionsDelegate = self;
 
 [_mapView loadDirectionsFrom:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(51.38713, -1.0316)
                           to:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(51.4554, -0.9742)
                    routeType:MTDDirectionsRouteTypeFastestDriving
         zoomToShowDirections:YES];
