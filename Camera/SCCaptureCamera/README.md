Usage：
----------
1、Drag "SCCaptureCamera" and "SCCommon" to your project.

2、Import "SCNavigationController.h" and code like this:
```
    SCNavigationController *nav = [[SCNavigationController alloc] init];
    nav.scNaigationDelegate = self;
    [nav showCameraWithParentController:self];
```    
3、After take a picture, you can call back with delegate or a notification.

a. delegate:
```
- (void)didTakePicture:(SCNavigationController *)navigationController image:(UIImage *)image
```
b. notification:
```
add a notification whose name is kNotificationTakePicture (just search "kNotificationTakePicture" in my demo project)
```



Finally, set "SWITCH_SHOW_DEFAULT_IMAGE_FOR_NONE_CAMERA" which is in the file "SCCaptureCameraController.m" to 0, it is just a joke for the devices which cannot take a picture.
