## DIYMenu

It's a modal menu that looks OK. It's a singleton and it'll send strings to a delegate based on what selections the user makes.

## Getting Started

```objective-c
#import "DIYMenu.h"
```

Setup:
```objective-c

UIFont *font = [UIFont fontWithName:@"Helvetica-Neue" size:32];

// Set the delegate
[DIYMenu setDelegate:self];

// Add menu items
[DIYMenu addMenuItem:@"Portfolio" withIcon:[UIImage imageNamed:@"portfolioIcon@2x.png"] withColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:0.18f green:0.76f blue:0.93f alpha:1.0f] withFont:font];
[DIYMenu addMenuItem:@"Skills" withIcon:[UIImage imageNamed:@"skillsIcon@2x.png"] withColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:0.28f green:0.55f blue:0.95f alpha:1.0f] withFont:font];
```

Use:
```objective-c
[DIYMenu show];
```

Then implement the delegate methods and do stuff I guess.

PS â€“ Link these bad babies:

```bash
QuartzCore.framework
CoreGraphics.framework
```

## Methods
```objective-c

// Show / dismiss / check status
+ (void)show;
+ (void)dismiss;
+ (BOOL)isActivated;

// Setup
+ (void)setDelegate:(NSObject<DIYMenuDelegate> *)delegate;

+ (void)addMenuItem:(NSString *)name withIcon:(UIImage *)image withColor:(UIColor *)color withFont:(UIFont *)font;
```

## Delegate Methods
```objective-c
@protocol DIYMenuDelegate <NSObject>
@required
- (void)menuItemSelected:(NSString *)action;
@optional
- (void)menuActivated;
- (void)menuCancelled;
@end
```

## Configuration
DIYMenuOptions holds some config options so you can set the default font and some sizes and stuff.

## iOS Support
DIYMenu is tested on iOS 5 and up.

## ARC
If you are including DIYMenu in a project that uses [Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html), you will need to set the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag on all of the DIYCam source files. To do this in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. Now select all DIYCam source files, press Enter, insert `-fno-objc-arc` and then "Done" to disable ARC for DIYCam.
