#CFShareCircle

CFShareCircle is a better way for app developers to let users share the content to many different services. It is a simple UIView that adds drag and share capabilities to a developers application. View was only tested on iOS 6.0, but should be 5.1+ capable. It now includes an additional menu when you have more than 6 different services to share to for your users!

##How To Use

Follow the instructions to add CFShareCircle to your project.

###Installation

1. CFShareCircle can be installed via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/). Simply add `pod 'CFShareCircle'` to your Podfile. If you don't use Cocoapods you're welcome to use git submodules, or simply [download](https://github.com/camdenfullmer/CFShareCircle/archive/master.zip) the files manually. If you go with the manual route just include the files located in Classes and Resources to your project.

2. Edit your view controller header file to import the CFShareCircle header file, add the delegate, and create an object.

    ```
    #import "CFShareCircleView.h"
    
    @interface ViewController : UIViewController <CFShareCircleViewDelegate> {    
        CFShareCircleView *shareCircleView;        
    }
      ```
      
3. In your viewDidLoad method instantiate the CFShareCircle, set up the delegate, and add it to your navigation controller.
```
- (void)viewDidLoad {
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        shareCircleView = [[CFShareCircleView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame];
        shareCircleView.delegate = self;
        [self.navigationController.view addSubview:shareCircleView];
        [super viewDidLoad];
}
```

3. Implement the delegate method for the view.
``` 
    - (void)shareCircleView:(CFShareCircleView *)aShareCircleView didSelectSharer:(CFSharer *)sharer {
        NSLog(@"Selected sharer: %@", sharer.name);
    }
```

4. Finally just show the view whenever you want it pop up for the user.
```
    [shareCircleView show];
```

###Customize CFShareCirlce

If you would like to determine what the CFShareCircle view shows, all you have to do is intialize your own array of sharers.

```
shareCircleView = [[CFShareCircleView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame sharers:[[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithObjects: [CFSharer twitter], [CFSharer facebook], [CFSharer dropbox], nil]];
```

Then to extend this you can create your own CFSharer objects, just provide your own name for the sharer and image. Note that icons should be 100px by 100px for retina and 50px by 50px for standard.

```
CFSharer *newSharer = [[CFSharer alloc] initWithName:@"Facebook" imageName:@"facebook.png"];
```

    - Evernote

    - Google Drive

    - Pinterest

    - Mail
