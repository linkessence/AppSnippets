Last updated: 3th July 2012

Thanks for downloading some of my source code!

This is the license agreement for the source code which this document accompanies (don’t worry: you’re allowed to use it in your own products, commercial or otherwise).

The full license text is further down this page, and you should only use the source code if you agree to the terms in that text. For convenience, though, I’ve put together a human-readable **non-authoritative** interpretation of the license which will hopefully answer any questions you have.



## Your rights and obligations

Basically, the license says that:

1.	You can use the code in your own products, including commercial and/or closed-source products.
2.	You can modify the code as you wish, and use the modified code in your products.
3.	You can redistribute the original, unmodified code, but you have to include the full license text below.
4.	You can redistribute the modified code as you wish (without the full license text below).
5.	In all cases, you must include a credit mentioning Sendoa Portuondo as the original author of the source.
6.	Sendoa Portuondo is not liable for anything you do with the code, no matter what. So be sensible.
7.	You can’t use the name Sendoa Portuondo or any other related marks to promote your products based on the code.
8.	If you agree to all of that, go ahead and use the source. Otherwise, don’t!



## Suggested Attribution Format

The license requires that you give credit to Sendoa Portuondo, as the original author of any of my source that you use. The placement and format of the credit is up to you, but we prefer the credit to be in the software’s "About" window or similar location. Alternatively, you could put the credit in a list of acknowledgements within the software, in the software’s documentation, or on the web page for the software. The suggested format for the attribution is:

**Includes [Name of Code] code by [Sendoa Portuondo](http://www.sportuondo.com/)**

where [Name of Code] would be replaced by the name of the specific source-code package you made use of. Where possible, please link the text "Sendoa Portuondo" to the following URL, or include the URL as plain text: http://www.sportuondo.com/
