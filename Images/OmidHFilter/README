How to use
-----------

This is pretty simple:

1. a) #import "UIImage+FiltrrCompositions.h" if you want to use the predefined effects
	or
   b) #import "UIImage+Filtrr.h" if you want to compose your own effects

2a) Just call the method on your image and you will get back a manipulated image.
    UIImage *img = [UIImage imageNamed:@"test.jpg"];
    img = [img e1];
    anImageViewController.image = img;

2b) To compose your own effect:

    UIImage *img = [UIImage imageNamed:@"test.jpg"];
    
    UIImage *topImage = [img duplicate];
    topImage = [[topImage saturationByFactor:0] blur];

    img = [self multiply:topImage];
    
    RGBA minrgb, maxrgb;

    minrgb = RGBAMake(60, 35, 10, 255);
    maxrgb = RGBAMake(170, 140, 160, 255);
    
    img = [[[self tintWithMinRGB:minrgb MaxRGB:maxrgb] contrastByFactor:0.8] brightnessByFactor:10];
    
    anImageViewController.image = img;

Enjoy it and feel free to send me your composed effects!
