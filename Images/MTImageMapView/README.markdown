# MTImageMapView

An UIImageView subclass to select a complex polygon map out of many.<br/>
Extremely useful for handling touches on, for example, Europe map, or an eye of owl.

## Features

- Handling multiple maps on an image.<sup>1</sup> 
- Multiple MTImageMapView on a single view
- Support Interface Builder, or progmatical initiation
- Batch mapping. <sup>2</sup> 
- Completion block for notifying the end of mapping.<sup>3</sup> 
- Delegate to provide selected map index
- Single public class and protocol to implement
- Debug mode to superimpose maps on an image

<ol>
	<li>There is no limit but you need to be reasonable. In this example, I put around 50.</li>
	<li>Mapping takes place in background and prevents UI animation from stuttering.</li>
	<li>At the end of mapping, mapping function notifies on main thread.</li>
</ol>

## Support

- Works on iOS 4.3 ~ iOS 6.0 (tested on devices.)
- XCode 4.4 or higher required.

### TBA
- ARC.
- Zoom in/out.

## Implementation
1. Use tools like [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) and generate image map.
2. Copy only coordinate pairs of a map (e.g. "123,242,452,242,142,322") in NSString type.
3. Implement MTImageMapDelegate procotol
4. Put them in an NSArray.
5. pass the array to map view.
   (You can use .plist to contain such maps set and drop it into a MTImageMapView. )

```objective-c
    MTImageMapView *viewImageMap =\
        [[MTImageMapView alloc]
         initWithImage:
            [UIImage imageNamed:@"sample_image.png"]
         ];

    [viewImageMap setDelegate:self];
    [self.view addSubview:viewImageMap];
    
    NSArray *arrStates = \
        [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
         @"542,94,568,94,568,111,542,111"
         @"555,150,574,150,574,161,555,161"
         @"535,149,551,149,551,159,535,159"
         ,nil];

    [viewImageMap
     setMapping:arrStates
     doneBlock:^(MTImageMapView *imageMapView) {
         NSLog(@"Mapping complete!");
     }];
```

```objective-c
	-(void)imageMapView:(MTImageMapView *)inImageMapView
	   didSelectMapArea:(NSUInteger)inIndexSelected
	{
	    [[[[UIAlertView alloc]
	     initWithTitle:@"*** State Name ***"
	     message:[stateNames objectAtIndex:inIndexSelected]
	     delegate:nil
	     cancelButtonTitle:@"Ok"
	     otherButtonTitles:nil]
	      autorelease] show];
	}
```
### LIMITS
- Delegate only receives the index of a map.
- Coordinates must be provided in pairs.
- At least 3 pairs of coordinates must be presented.
- No "rect", "circle" type map is supported. "Polygon" only at this time being.
