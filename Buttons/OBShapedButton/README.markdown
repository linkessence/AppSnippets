OBShapedButton
==============

OBShapedButton is a UIButton subclass optimized for non-rectangular button shapes.
Instances of OBShapedButton respond to touches only in areas where the image that is
assigned to the button for UIControlStateNormal is non-transparent.

 
Usage
-----

* Add OBShapedButton.h, OBShapedButton.m, UIImage+ColorAtPixel.h, and UIImage+ColorAtPixel.m
  to your Xcode project.
* Design your UI in Interface Builder with UIButtons as usual. Set the Button type to Custom
  and provide transparent PNG images for the different control states as needed.
* In the Identity Inspector in Interface Builder, set the Class of the button to OBShapedButton.
  That's it! Your button will now only respond to touches where the PNG image for the normal
  control state is non-transparent.
